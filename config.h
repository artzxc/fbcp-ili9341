#define STATISTICS

// How often the on-screen statistics is refreshed (in usecs)
#define STATISTICS_REFRESH_INTERVAL 200000

// How many usecs worth of past frame rate data do we preserve in the history buffer. Higher values
// make the frame rate display counter smoother and respond to changes with a delay, whereas smaller

#define FRAMERATE_HISTORY_LENGTH 400000

// If defined, no sleeps are specified and the code runs as fast as possible. This should not improve
// performance, as the code has been developed with the mindset that sleeping should only occur at
// times when there is no work to do, rather than sleeping to reduce power usage. The only expected
// effect of this is that CPU usage shoots to 200%, while display update FPS is the same. Present
// here to allow toggling to debug this assumption.
// #define NO_THROTTLING

// If defined, display updates are synced to the vsync signal provided by the VideoCore GPU. That seems
// to occur quite precisely at 60 Hz. Testing on PAL NES games that run at 50Hz, this will not work well,
// since they produce new frames at every 20msecs, and the VideoCore functions for snapshotting also will
// output new frames at this vsync-detached interval, so there's a 50 Hz vs 60 Hz mismatch that results
// in visible microstuttering. Still, providing this as an option, this might be good for content that
// is known to run at native 60Hz.
// #define USE_GPU_VSYNC

// If defined, progressive updating is always used (at the expense of slowing down refresh rate if it's
// too much for the display to handle)
// #define NO_INTERLACING

// If defined, all frames are always rendered as interlaced, and never use progressive rendering.
// #define ALWAYS_INTERLACING

// By default, if the SPI bus is idle after rendering an interlaced frame, but the GPU has not yet produced
// a new application frame to be displayed, the same frame will be rendered again for its other field.
// Define this option to disable this behavior, in which case when an interlaced frame is rendered, the 
// remaining other field half of the image will never be uploaded.
// #define THROTTLE_INTERLACING

// If defined, the GPU polling thread will be put to sleep for 1/TARGET_FRAMERATE seconds after receiving
// each new GPU frame, to wait for the earliest moment that the next frame could arrive.
#define SAVE_BATTERY_BY_SLEEPING_UNTIL_TARGET_FRAME

#define SAVE_BATTERY_BY_SLEEPING_WHEN_IDLE

// Builds a histogram of observed frame intervals and uses that to sync to a known update rate. This aims
// to detect if an application uses a non-60Hz update rate, and synchronizes to that instead.
#define SAVE_BATTERY_BY_PREDICTING_FRAME_ARRIVAL_TIMES

// Specifies how fast to communicate the SPI bus at. Possible values are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ... Smaller
// values are faster. On my PiTFT 2.8 and Waveshare32b displays, divisor value of 4 does not work, and
// 6 is the fastest possible. While developing, it was observed that a value of 12 or higher did not
// actually work either, and only 6, 8 and 10 were functioning properly.
